Season generously with salt & pepper. While your vegetables are cooking, prepare your pasta in salted water and cook following packet instructions.\nAdd the minced garlic clove and fry for 30 seconds before adding the cherry tomatoes. Allow the tomatoes to soften and release their juices before adding the white wine. Cook on a high temperature for 2-3 minutes to allow the alcohol to burn off.\nAdd the tablespoon of tomato pure and stir well to create a sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add 1-2 ladles of the starchy pasta water.\nOnce cooked, use a slotted ladle and add the pasta straight to the vegetable sauce. Then add the tinned sweetcorn and cook for a further 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir through the cheddar cheese before adding the chopped parsley for serving.","serves":2,"favourite":true,"category":{"id":1,"title":"Vegetarian","slug":"vegetarian","published_at":"2022-03-27T19:19:39.809Z","created_at":"2022-03-27T19:19:37.413Z","updated_at":"2022-03-27T19:19:39.827Z"},"slug":"garden-pasta","cook_time":"25","published_at":"2022-03-28T13:12:04.683Z","created_at":"2022-03-28T13:09:22.142Z","updated_at":"2022-04-01T13:08:37.164Z","tags":[{"id":1,"title":"Healthy","published_at":"2022-03-28T13:09:35.454Z","created_at":"2022-03-28T13:09:32.480Z","updated_at":"2022-03-28T13:09:35.469Z","slug":"healthy"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
